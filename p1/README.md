My application should be able to read both P3 and P6 formatted images into memory.
Also, Writing to P3 and P6 formatted images from memory should be working on my program.
Thus, converting from P3/P6 to P3 and P3/P6 to P6 are my project expections.

How to use:
My program will run correctly if users follow this input pattern:
ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm  or
ppmrw 6 input.ppm output.ppm
Otherwise, an error message will be shown
